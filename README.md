# Aggregate Functions and Grouping

# Task Overview
This repository contains the submission for **Task 4** of the SQL Developer Internship.  
The objective of this task is to use SQL **aggregate functions** and **grouping** to summarize and analyze tabular data from a sample sales system.

| `Task4.sql`    | SQL script with table schema, 15 sample rows, and SQL queries    |
| `README.md`    | Project documentation                                            |
| `Screenshots`  | Output screenshots of SQL queries                                |

#  Key Concepts Covered

- `GROUP BY` clause
- Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`
- Filtering grouped data with `HAVING`
- Using `ROUND()` for numeric precision
- Calculating `VAR_SAMP()` and `STDDEV_SAMP()`
- Using subqueries inside SELECT

# Tools & Technologies Used

**MySQL Workbench** – Used to write and run SQL scripts  
**GitHub** – For version control and submission

# Learning Outcomes

Through this task, I gained practical experience in:

- Using SQL aggregation to generate summary insights
- Grouping and filtering large sets of data
- Applying basic statistics (mean, variance, std dev) in SQL
- Writing cleaner and more structured analytical queries
